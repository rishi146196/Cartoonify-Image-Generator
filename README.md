# Cartoonify Image Generator

## Overview
The **Cartoonify Image Generator** is a Python-based web application that transforms ordinary images into vibrant, cartoon-like visuals. Utilizing the power of computer vision and image processing, this project demonstrates how creativity and technology can blend seamlessly.

---

## Features
- Converts uploaded images into stunning cartoon-style visuals.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for image upload and result viewing.
- Uses advanced image processing techniques like bilateral filtering, k-means clustering, and edge detection.
- Ensures vibrant colors and smooth textures in the cartoonified output.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the web interface.

---

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Upload an image using the provided form.
3. View the cartoonified version of your image on the results page.
4. Download the output if desired.

---

## How It Works
1. **Upload:** The user uploads an image through the web interface.
2. **Processing:** The uploaded image undergoes the following steps:
   - **Smoothing:** Reduces noise using a bilateral filter.
   - **Color Quantization:** Clusters colors using k-means for a simplified palette.
   - **Edge Detection:** Identifies edges using adaptive thresholding.
   - **Blending:** Combines edges and quantized colors for the cartoon effect.
3. **Output:** The cartoonified image is displayed and available for download.
